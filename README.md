# Movie Recommendation Engine Building in Apache Spark
## Overview
In this project, the movie data is movie lens data set which includes about 600 users and 9500 movies.

The purpose of the project are to:

* find similar movies.

* gain insights on movie recommendations to users.


To achieve the goal, we will:

* Train the regression model with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm.

* Predict movie rating and recommend movies to users.

* Find the correlations between different movies and infer similarities.

This will be implemented on Spark due to its fast speed for large-scale data processing and readiness to use.
